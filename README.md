# SOLID_Principal_Code_Example
Maintaining clean, scalable, and maintainable code is 
essential in the constantly changing world of software 
engineering. Robert C. Martin’s SOLID principles provide
a set of instructions for doing just that. We’ll delve further
into these concepts in this article and examine how you may use
them as your best practices for software development.

What are SOLID Design Principles?
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
