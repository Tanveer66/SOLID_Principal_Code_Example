The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The open-closed principle states that classes, modules, and functions should be
 open for extension but closed for modification. It is a fundamental guideline that 
 plays a pivotal role in building robust and maintainable systems.

Open for Extension :

A software entity should be open for extension, allowing new or existing functionality 
to be added or extended without altering its source code. This promotes flexibility and
 adaptability in software by allowing users to build upon or customize a component’s 
 behavior.

Closed for modification :

“Closed for modification” refers to a software entity’s source code remaining unchanged 
after stability testing, ensuring reliability and unaffected by system changes, and 
preventing new features or bug fixes, after thorough validation and testing.

The Role of OCP in Building Robust Systems

· Reduced Risk of Bugs

· Enhanced Scalability

· Encapsulation

· Code Reusability

· Easier collaboration
