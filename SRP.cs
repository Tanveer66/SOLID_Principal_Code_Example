/*
The Customer class is now responsible solely for storing customer information. 
It has no knowledge of email sending logic.

Â· The EmailService class is introduced to handle email-related responsibilities. 
It encapsulates the logic for sending email notifications.

This refactoring adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. 
The Customer class has one reason to change (customer information-related changes), 
and the EmailService class has one reason to change (email-related changes). 
This separation makes the code more maintainable, easier to understand, 
and allows each class to evolve independently as per their specific responsibilities.
